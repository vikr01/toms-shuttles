First, clone the repo via git:

```

## Run in Development Mode

It is recommended to run the backend and frontend in separate terminal sessions.

See [the instructions in the frontend package](./packages/frontend) for starting the frontend.

```bash
yarn dev
```

```

Then start the application in production by running:
